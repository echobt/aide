//! Tauri commands for the debugger
//!
//! This module exposes the DAP functionality as Tauri commands that can be
//! invoked from the frontend.
//!
//! The module is organized into logical submodules:
//! - `state`: Global debugger state management
//! - `types`: Request/response types for commands
//! - `session`: Session management (start, stop, get sessions)
//! - `breakpoints`: Breakpoint management (set, toggle, get)
//! - `execution`: Execution control (continue, pause, step)
//! - `threads`: Thread and stack frame operations
//! - `variables`: Variable inspection and evaluation
//! - `memory`: Memory and disassembly operations
//! - `navigation`: Code navigation (goto, step-in targets)
//! - `misc`: Miscellaneous commands (completions, sources, modules)
