# Module README Generator for Aide VSCode Extension

## Task Description

You're tasked with creating comprehensive README files for the modules of the Aide VSCode extension, an AI-powered code assistance tool. Each README should explain the module's purpose, functionality, and integration with the larger system to help developers (both current and future) understand the codebase.

## Context

The Aide codebase is complex with multiple interconnected modules. Each module serves a specific purpose within the extension's architecture. These READMEs will serve as documentation to help developers navigate and understand the codebase efficiently.

## Input Format

I will provide you with:

- The path to a specific module folder (e.g., `/src/extension/ai`)
- A directory listing showing all files and subdirectories within the module
- Access to key files through file attachments or code snippets

## Output Requirements

Create a comprehensive README.md file with the following sections:

1. **Module Overview**: Write 2-3 concise sentences describing the module's primary purpose and importance within the system.

2. **Core Functionality**: Create a bullet list (4-6 items) of the main capabilities this module provides. Format each bullet as "**Name**: Description".

3. **Key Components**: Organize components by category (e.g., by subdirectory or functional area). For each key file/class, include:
   - File name with extension
   - Brief description of its purpose
   - Key functionality it provides
4. **Dependencies**: List both internal module dependencies and external libraries with a brief explanation of how they're used.

5. **Usage Examples**: Provide 1-2 code examples showing how the module is typically used within the system. Use realistic variable names and include comments.

6. **Architecture Notes**: Explain the design patterns, data flow, and architectural decisions. Include a mermaid diagram when the module has complex interactions.

## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, technically precise language appropriate for experienced developers
- Focus on high-level functionality rather than implementation details
- Maintain a neutral, informative tone
- Structure information hierarchically with clear headings and subheadings
- Use bold formatting for emphasis on key terms
- Keep the entire README under 1000 words for quick reference
- Include a mermaid diagram for modules with complex interactions or data flows

This prompt has been structured to follow Anthropic's best practices with clear sections, specific instructions, and example formatting. It should help produce high-quality, consistent README files that match the style of the ones you've already created.
